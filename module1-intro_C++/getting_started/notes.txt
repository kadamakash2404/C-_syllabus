Basic components of a CPP progroma are as follows:

1 : Preprocessor Directives :

2 : Main function :

3 : Statements and Declerations

4 : Comments

Compilation process of a C++ program

1 : Preprocessing : 
                    It handles derictives like #include , #define replacing them with
                    actual code or modifing source code according to directives
                    the output is preprocessoed source code .i extension.

2 : Complation : 
                    preprocessoed code is passed to compiler (eg. g++, GNU compiler).
                    The compiler checks the syntax and semantics of the code, 
                    transleting it into a assembly code or an intermediate representation
                    specific of the target program.
                    Any errors found during this stage are reported as compiler error.

3 : Assembly :
                    the compiler generets an assembly code (.s) from the intermidiate 
                    representation or directly converts the code to object code.
                    Assembly  code is the human readable representation of the low level
                    instructions understand by machine.

4 : Linking :       
                    if the program consist of multiple source files or uses external
                    libraries, the linker ('ld' in Unix-Like system) combines the output 
                    files produced by the compiler into a single executable file.
                    It resolves refrences between different parts of the code and 
                    links necessery library functions.

5 : EXE output : 
                    finaly the linked produces the .EXE file from the linked object file.
                    The file contains binary code that the computers processor can execute.
